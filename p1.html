<li>Definition:A database can be described as a shared set of interrelated data designed to serve an organization's varied knowledge needs. (McFadden and Hoffer respectively)</li>
<li>Advantages:1-Data management A DBMS provides a mechanism to manage the data held by an organization more easily</li>
<li>2-Data independence The data is stored independently of the application programs which use it in a database system. Changes in the data or the way it is processed do not automatically impact the data-using systems</li>
<li>3-Data integrity To reduce complexity a database framework is built. Ideally data items are stored in one location only. When improvements are made to the records, adjustments to this one position can only be created. This significantly improves the accuracy of test responses collected on the database</li>
<li>4-Data sharing Data collection in a central data repository and managed by a DBMS allows multiple users and applications to share the data</li>
<li>5-Increased usability File systems are now fixed in the framework of the database. Then, new programming programs that use such frameworks can be created. That results in shorter periods of growth</li>
<li>6-Reduced maintenance A number of tools are already built into most DBMS to maintain the data. Resources can include generators of files, query languages, generators of formats, code checkers, dictionaries of text, and logs of maintenance</li>
</ul>
