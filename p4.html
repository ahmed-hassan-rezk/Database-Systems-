</ul>
<ul>
<li>Database layout:A single body composed of a set of interrelated data is constructed as</li>
<li>Repository: Which contains the rules that enable users to access the data and the rules that organize the data , is metadata</li>
<li>End users: Who access the database</li>
<li>Interfaces: These are the specific ways that an end user may view the data via computer monitors, remote terminal telephone connections, touch screens, bar code readers, voice controls, control pads, graphical collection, keyboard or mouse menu options, button keys or scanning cards.The gui is often the manner in which the knowledge is presented eg log, written text, interactive presentation to the end consumer</li>
<li>Program programs: which are used to build, alter, remove and retrieve the key operations on the files. Software systems often integrate the data to generate accurate reports</li>
<li>Database Management System (DBMS):Which is the set of programs that control the database configuration and define the registry rules and even handle multi-user device user access</li>
<li>Computer-assisted information development methods (CASE tools):also known as part of the database system. These are software resources that assist with program architecture and database construction</li>
<li>Database Administrators (DBA): Manage the DBMS and are accountable for an organisation's internal database infrastructure. In a later section you'll look more thoroughly at the DBA 's position</li>
<li>Device Developers: Provide researchers and programmers for the applications. Among other modules you'll look at the function of each of these. Both use CASE tools to help develop application programmes</li>
</ul>
