<li>Centralized Database Systems:The first category in types of database systems is the centralized Database system. Complete database in this category is stored in one location. All accesses to any data sub-set will be to that centralized location. Centralized control is data recovery and update.This function often raises the problem of device insecurity. Resource availability is at the central site, so data base system failure chances are increasing multiples. The downside is that the Database appears to be under DBA supervision, prohibiting any unmonitored access to the database</li>
<li>Distributed Database Systems:The data is stored on multiple computers in a Distributed Database. These computers may be PCs or mainframe computers. All the data storage computers connect with each other via diverse networking channels, such as high speed networks or telephone lines</li>
